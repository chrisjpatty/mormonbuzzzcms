If you’re anything like me you’ve probably forgotten once or twice to silence your phone at Church. There are worse sins to be certain, and after all, nothing really punctuates the sacrament like a few bars of Hello Dolly's [_It Takes a Woman_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeH3bOrCdoA). But if your ward members don’t appreciate egregiously sexist show tunes quite as much as yourself, then you may want to consider following these instructions to automatically silence your phone whenever you’re at church.

Yes, you heard me correctly, with a simple app available for both Android and IOS, you can save yourself the embarrassment of explaining away your Backstreet Boys ringtone. It’s called IFTTT which stands for “If This, Then That”.


### Get the App



The first step is obviously to download the app for your respective device (Sorry Windows phone users, you're out of luck).

### Initial Setup



The initial setup is easy, just download the app, and make an account. IFTTT is useful for more than just muting your phone. The app works by using "recipes", which are just simple instructions for how to link together your favorite apps and services. If you think about the name, "If This Then That", you'll get an idea of how it works. We're going to install a recipe that will let your phone figure out when it's in a church building and then tell it to silence your phone, or in other words, _if_ your phone is in a church building _then_ silence your phone. Once you've got the app setup skip down to the instructions for your device.


### Instructions for Android



If you're using an Android phone, congratulations, this is going to be much easier for you. Unlike Apple, Android allows apps to control the volume of your phone. Now in your case what we're going to do is watch for when your phone connects to the Church's wifi network, "LDSAccess". Like the Gospel, the Church's wifi name and password is the same everywhere, so this recipe should work for you in any church building. The only requirement is that you've connected to the Church's wifi at least once before. Since you've probably already done that at some point, I've taken the liberty of creating this recipe for you. To install it just click the "add" button below on your phone.

That's it! Pretty easy right? Now just a caveat, Android devices vary greatly; there's no guarantee that this recipe will work reliably on your phone, so you might want to monitor it the first time just to make sure it actually works for you. In my experience I've found that while all Android phones will silence the ringtone, not all will silence the media volume, so if you're planning to scroll through Vine in-between sacrament meeting and Sunday school, you might want to make sure it actually is silenced.



### Instructions for Apple



Alright Apple users, I have two pieces of bad news. First, Apple doesn't allow apps on iOS to change the phone's volume so the process isn't quite as automatic. What we can do instead is have it send you a notification when you get to church to remind you to turn it down. Second, unlike Android, iOS can't tell when you're in a specific wifi network, namely, "LDSAccess". What we can do instead, however, is use your phone's location to accomplish the same thing. To get started just click the "Add" button below. For this recipe to work just change the address to your local church building and you'll get a friendly reminder when you get to church to silence your phone.

That's it! You're all set! You can repeat this process to add more church buildings or other places like Institutes, or Temples.



### You're all done!



See, that was pretty easy. IFTTT is great for all kinds of similar uses. For example, you can have it remind you once a month to get your home/visiting teaching done, or have it log to a spreadsheet when you read your scriptures to track your reading habits. The possibilities are almost limitless. If you have any ideas for other Mormon IFTTT recipes, or maybe just need some help getting this one setup, just let me know in the comments below. Be sure to share this tip with your friends so you can all keep your embarrassing ringtones a secret.
