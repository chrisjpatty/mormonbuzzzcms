Have you ever wondered what Disney movies would be like if the characters we all know and love were members of the Church? Well, we did. Here are a few examples of classic Disney moments gone Mormon: 


### 1. Elder Woody gets a little jealous of Elder Lightyear's new calling.

### 2. It looks like Hercules returned home with a little more than honor.
