"_I Need Thee Every Hour_ with a soulful twist", is a good way to describe the Mormon Channel's newly released music video. The video features the vocal talents of Debra and Harry Bonner and their eight children, singing an original song entitled "I Am Here." It's both a beautiful rendition of, and confident response to, the familiar hymn.





Debra and Harry served as Baptist missionaries in Africa before eventually joining the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. They and their children hope to share, through song, the message that we need God and He is here for us.
