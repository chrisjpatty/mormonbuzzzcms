James Curran, who just recently hit number one on the Billboard new artist chart, just released his newest video entitled _Treasure_. The video features Yahosh Bonner and was written to help the world see that we are all Treasure in God's eyes. While we may be imperfect and we all struggle with different trials, we are all equal in God's eyes. Curran never fails to create uplifting beats that make us feel the feels.

Curran said that he wanted to help elevate the negative stereotype that the Church is non-inclusive or homophobic. He said, "No matter what your age, race, sexual orientation, gender, religion, or handicaps may be.. I KNOW God thinks you are TREASURE." After receiving backlash for the song and video, James concluded with;  "I will never apologize for believing wholeheartedly that all people on this earth are equal in God's eyes." James, keep doing what you're doing!
