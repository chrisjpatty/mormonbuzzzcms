James Curran, also known as Jamesthemormon on social media, decided to ‘rap’ his christmas gift this year with a brand new song and video. His latest project, entitled “Angels We Have Heard On High,” is less about Christ-centered rap and more about Christ-centered Christmas, and it’s one you need to see.

The music video was filmed in downtown Salt Lake City, where Curran and his collaborators passed out free food and clothing to the homeless. The song is an arrangement of “Angels We Have Heard On High,” featuring Junior Maile, Yahosh Bonner, Jay Warren, and Curran leading with an original rap. While the vocals are impressive and the rap inspiring, the arrangement was quickly thrown together to simply act as a backdrop for the video (beautifully produced by Cameron Gade from Catchlight Productions), made to inspire Christlike charity this holiday season. 

Curran teamed up with local businesses Bam Bams BBQ, Catchlight Productions, Traeger Grills and Stay Clothing, who donated clothing and food to create an unforgettable afternoon for over 300 people. He told Mormon Buzzz, “My purpose is to bring charity to Christmas, because that is the pure love of Christ.” Curran had the opportunity of doing a similar service project last year (you can watch that video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9--J11X5zs)), where he bought dozens of pizzas and passed out clothing. This year, however, he knew he could go a little bit bigger. “I would love to go bigger and bigger in the coming years,” he said. Some ideas Curran has are to invite every food truck in Provo to donate food and to involve even more businesses to make that much more of an impact.

Jamesthemormon’s willingness to share his talents as well as his example of Christlike charity are a call for all of us to do more for others this holiday season. Let’s think a little more outside of ourselves this Christmas and share the pure love of Christ through simple or big acts of charity. We never know what lives we’ll touch for good.
