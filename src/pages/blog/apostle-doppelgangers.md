From the time most of us exited the womb, we've been well trained to recognize the faces of our beloved prophets and apostles. It's almost second nature to us. Well, in that spirit, we scrounged up a few other familiar faces that look strikingly similar to our favorite church leaders. Here are some crazy apostle doppelgangers that you might recognize.


### Thomas S. Monson and the late senator Arlen Spector

They say religion and politics don't mix, but sometimes...


### President Eyring and Grant Wood's "American Gothic" Painting

President Eyring's a lot more chipper than his famous doppelganger, but you get the 'picture.'


### Dieter F. Uchtdorf and Chief Justice Warren Burger

"Silver Fox" of the First Presidency? Meet "Silver Fox" of the Supreme Court.


### Boyd K. Packer and Donald Rumsfeld, 21st U.S. Secretary of Defense

President Packer is basically the LDS Church Secretary of Defense, let's be honest.


### M. Russell Ballard and Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's

Quality is BOTH of their recipes.


### L. Tom Perry and actor Elliott Denholm (circa _Indiana Jones_)



![perry and demlin](/img/perry-and-demlin.jpg)

I don't know about you, but _L. Tom Perry and the Last Crusade_ would have made a pretty legit alternative title.


### Dallin H.Oaks and actor Yul Brynner (circa _The Ten Commandments_)



![oaks brynner](/img/oaks-brynner.jpg)

Elder Oaks would have let your people go the first time, Charlton Heston.


### Elder Christofferson and actor Edward Herrmann (circa _Annie_)




[![fdr christoff](/img/fdr-christoff.jpg)](/img/fdr-christoff.jpg)Go back and watch_ Annie_ and try _not_ to picture Elder Christofferson singing, "Tomorrow." We dare you.


### Quinton L. Cook and actor Jason Alexander (circa "Seinfield")

The lovable personality store called, and they're fresh outta Elder Cook.


### Elder Nelson and President Richard Nixon




[![nelson nixon2](/img/nelson-nixon2.jpg)](/img/nelson-nixon2.jpg)

President Nixon probably should have stuck to "strait is the gate and narrow the way," like his beloved lookalike, instead of that other "gate"...


### Elder Bednar and Chief Justice John Roberts




[![bednar roberts](/img/bednar-roberts.jpg)](/img/bednar-roberts.jpg)

It's not too hard to imagine Elder Bednar laying down the law. Oyez, oyez, oyez!


### Elder Hales and Al Gore




[![hales gore](/img/hales-gore.jpg)](/img/hales-gore.jpg)

Note: despite popular myth, Elder Hales DID NOT in fact invent the Internet, and neither did his famous lookalike.


### Elder Holland and Paul McCartney




[![holland mccartney](/img/holland-mccartney.jpg)](/img/holland-mccartney.jpg)

"It's been a hard day's night, but the triumphant and glorious return of the Messiah shall come."

Yeah. We can dig it.


### Elder Andersen and actor Gregory Peck (circa _To Kill a Mockingbird_)




[![peck andersen](/img/peck-andersen.jpg)](/img/peck-andersen.jpg)

One's a debonair 1950s-era charmer, and the other's some actor.


### Elder Scott and actor Ian McDiarmid (circa _Star Wars, Episode II_)




[![scottpalp](/img/scottpalp.jpg)](/img/scottpalp.jpg)

We can't imagine Elder Scott hurting a fly, let alone the entire Galactic Republic, but if ever he wanted to be a stunt double, an opportunity was lost here.
