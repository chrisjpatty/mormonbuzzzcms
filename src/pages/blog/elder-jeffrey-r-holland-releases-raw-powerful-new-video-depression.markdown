In a ground-breaking new video posted on his Facebook page today, Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles directly addresses depression and mental illness. The video expands upon Holland's [talk from the October 2013 General Conference, "Like a Broken Vessel."](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2013/10/like-a-broken-vessel?lang=eng) and also features members of the church who struggle with mental illness. It's honest, emotional, and incredibly hopeful, and we think it's something you need to see.

In his Facebook post, Elder Holland wrote:

"Three years ago, I felt impressed to speak at general conference about the painful, life-altering condition of depression that affects so many.

"We came to earth to face issues of mortality in the form of trials, temptations, disease, and death. It is essential for us to face personal struggles because opposition is a crucial part of Father’s plan. I suppose everybody will have some kind of an experience where they say, “I’m never going to be happy again.”

"Well, we are going to be happy again. That is also a part of the plan. It’s the very nature of it. Hang on and hope. Never lose faith in your Father in Heaven, who loves you more than you can comprehend. Never, ever doubt His love for you. Hold fast to the Atonement. Believe in miracles. When you’ve done all you can do, endure to the end. And remember, hope is never lost.

"Broken minds can be healed just the way broken bones and broken hearts are healed. While God is at work making those repairs, the rest of us can help by being merciful, nonjudgmental, and kind."
