The [Mormon Channel](https://www.mormonchannel.org/) recently posted this cover of "I'm Trying to Be Like Jesus" by Emily Brown, and it's pretty much the best primary cover we've ever heard. Here's the video:



Yeah, we knew you'd love it. They've even provided a free download which you can find [here.](https://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/music-videos/im-trying-to-be-like-jesus-emily-brown)

We know it's going on our iPods.

More of Emily's music can be found on her [Sound Cloud.](https://soundcloud.com/listen-to-emily-brown)
