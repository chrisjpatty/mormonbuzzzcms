Mothers Day, in my opinion, is one of the most important holidays of the year. Mothers are the glue that holds our society together. The First Presidency called motherhood seven decades ago “the highest, holiest service … assumed by mankind.” So to celebrate mothers this day we compiled some of the best videos on the web to express our love and appreciation.




### 1. We Can't Stop...Having Babies




Chad and Andrea were accustomed to lots of excitement and support from friends and family when they had their twins girls and later their first boy. However, they were surprised by the lack of enthusiasm from their loved ones when they announced that they were pregnant with their 4th child. So in response to the judgment they received they made this music video that went viral, and we absolutely loved it.

### 2. The Unique Connection




This advertisement by Pandora Jewelry warmed our hearts as we watched blindfolded children try to identify their mother from a line of women. The results made us melt!

### 3. Olympics - Thank You Mom




P&G wanted to remind the world who was the driving force behind the olympic athletes really was; Mom. As the proud sponsor of moms, P&G want to say thank you to the Mom's. You are going to love it as much as we did.

### 4. Mom's 1st Birthday




Pampers Japan produced this video to allow some fathers to show their wives how much their first year of motherhood meant to them. We were blown away.

### 5. Ryan's unforgettable Mother's Day delivery to Mom




This Teleflora commercial made us all a little misty. This son's tribute to to his single mother was absolutely touching and you are going to love what he does for his mother.
