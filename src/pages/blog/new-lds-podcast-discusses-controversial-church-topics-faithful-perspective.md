Seer stones, DNA evidence, and homosexuality are just a few topics that will be discussed on "[LDS Perspectives](http://www.ldsperspectives.com/),” a new LDS podcast launched today that aims at covering controversial subjects from a faith-based perspective. The podcast speaks to hard questions members of the Church may have about current issues while maintaining a spiritual foundation. Of the podcast,[ the “LDS Perspectives” creators state:
](http://www.ldsperspectives.com/podcasters/)




<blockquote>
	“Over the past few years, the podcasting landscape has seen many presentations come and go, leaving many wondering where to go for faithful scholarship.”
   “LDS Perspectives Podcast grew out of a desire to fill that void. We hope to offer a place for mainstream members to learn more context about history, seek more depth to doctrine, and gain more support with cultural challenges. And all in a half-hour podcast.”
</blockquote>




[The first episode](http://www.ldsperspectives.com/2016/09/19/episode-1-historical-jesus/), released today, features LDS historian Dr. Thomas Wayment, who discusses with one of the show’s creators, Laura Harris Hales, how our modern view of the Bible has shaped the way we study and understand the historical nature of Jesus Christ. 




<blockquote>"Often we concentrate our study of the New Testament on the teachings and ministry of Jesus, but there is value in studying the historical Jesus. Do we sometimes forget that he was a man who lived over 2000 years ago in Palestine? Do we think about what kind of clothes he wore? Were they the same or different than those commonly portrayed in portraits? Does what he was wearing tell us anything about Jesus as a man or lend understanding to the stories of the miracles of Jesus? Biblical historians believe it does. These are the things that made Jesus a man living in his time and set him apart from the many itinerant preachers of the period."</blockquote>




LDS Perspectives has an impressive lineup of scholars and speakers to be featured in upcoming episodes, including notable members like Brad Wilcox, and Ty Mansfield.
