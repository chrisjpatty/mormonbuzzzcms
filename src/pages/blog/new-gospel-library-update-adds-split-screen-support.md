If you haven't received it yet, get ready for a fresh new update to the [Gospel Library app](http://gospellibrary.lds.org?CID=gospel_library_website_campaign) for phones and tablets. Version 4 of the app includes new and updated features like split screen compatibility for iPads, new annotation functionalities, and some extra color schemes.




### Split Screen Support

Split screen mode for iPad users has been a much anticipated feature since the release of iOS 9 in the fall of 2015. For those unfamiliar with the feature, most new models of the Apple iPad support a ["split screen" mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202070) which allows you to run two compatible apps side by side. With the Gospel Library version 4 and a compatible device, this feature has been added. You can, for example, open your lesson plan in Google Docs on one half of your screen, and then copy over scriptures from the Gospel Library, or you can even split the screen with Facebook to make it more convenient to copy General Conference quotes into that argument you're having with your cousin.




### Better Android Multitasking






For Android users, this update integrates your "screens" within the app into your phone's multitasking drawer. For example, in previous versions you could add a new "screen" within the app, and then navigate to the screen manager to switch between scripture books. By default, screens are now represented as separate windows in the multitasking drawer. Watch the video above for an example of how this works.




### Inline Cross-References






Also included in this version is an updated interface for scripture references in the footnotes. In previous versions, clicking on a scripture reference would take you from your current place and open the reference. In version 4 the scripture references are inlined into the footnotes so you can get some extra perspectives without losing your place.





For a full list of the new features available for your particular phone or tablet, just update your app and you'll be presented with a brief walkthrough explaining the new features.
