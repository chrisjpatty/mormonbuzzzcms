The LDS Church announced today that starting next April, there will no longer be twice-yearly priesthood and general women meetings held during conference. Instead, each meeting will occur once a year. The Church's statement on the matter is as follows:


<blockquote>"Beginning in April 2018, the general women's session will no longer be held on the Saturday preceding the other sessions of general conference. Rather, the general priesthood and general women's sessions will each be held annually, with the general priesthood session being in April and the general women's session being in October."

"These meetings will originate from the Conference Center on Saturday evening following the morning and afternoon sessions of the conference."</blockquote>


According to the Church announcement, consolidating general conference sessions will assist in efforts to reduce and simplify the work of the Church and demands made on leaders and members.

This change is the largest since 2013, when the general Relief Society meeting was opened to young women and primary girls.

Changes to the sessions will be announced in a First Presidency letter read to congregations around the world.
