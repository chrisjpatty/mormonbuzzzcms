So apparently the whole Mormon blogging community decided to compare Star Wars with the Church for May the 4th (Including us). So we decided to gather them together into one post so you can get your Star Wars Mormon fix all in one place. First up:





## 6 Ways Star Wars Copied The Church









When I was younger, every Family Home Evening lesson seemed to relate back to Star Wars. I even remember encountering serious doubts in my testimony because it seemed that the Church was just a ripoff of Star Wars. After better understanding history, I can now confirm that the Church didn’t copy Star Wars. On the contrary, Star Wars copied the Church.


### Jedi Council/ Quorum of the Twelve


In a clear rip off of the modern Church structure, Star Wars introduces us to the “Jedi Council”, made up of Twelve Jedi Masters in charge of teaching younger Jedi and fighting evil. Sound familiar? Because it is EXACTLY like the Quorum of the Twelve, only with weirder skin.

The flattering but still unaccredited mimicking is even more obvious when you compare Yoda and President Hinckley. They even copied the cane!

## How Mormon Missionaries are like Jedi







[![Jedi, Mormons, LDS, May The 4th Be With You](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-E3l5t_CLt40/VUeBu7aqjxI/AAAAAAAAC8c/g-20bMSP_ls/s400/Jedi%2BMissionaries.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-E3l5t_CLt40/VUeBu7aqjxI/AAAAAAAAC8c/g-20bMSP_ls/s1600/Jedi%2BMissionaries.jpg)


As a missionary we often would talk about how Missionaries were like the Jedi, it was even brought up in a Zone Conference, one of the Assistants said "President Wilkey is like Yoda, listen to him". At lunch everyone talked about how Missionaries are like Jedi. Today is "May the 4th be with you" aka Star Wars day. Here are a few ways that Missionaries are like Jedi, if I missed one, add it in the comments, and I'll update this!











### **Over arching power**




The Jedi have the force.




Missionaries have the Spirit.










### **Dress code**




**
**Jedi have a dress code, most of them wear "Jedi robes".




Missionaries have a dress code, and also wear "robes".


### **Temples**







The Jedi receive training at the Jedi Temple.
Missionaries receive training at Mormon Temples.


### **Revelation**** **







Jedi when they need insight from the "force" they go meditate in the "meditation room" (in the Jedi Temple).




When Missionaries need insight from the Spirit they Pray, and if they can they go to the Celestial room (in a Mormon Temple).

## 10 Things Mormons and Star Wars Have in Common


“May the Fourth be with you!” That is the greeting that many Star Wars fans will be giving today. May 4th is officially “Star Wars Day,” a day that all Jedi enthusiasts celebrate.

Additionally, many fans of the Star Wars universe are excited for the filming of  [Episode VII](http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/29/showbiz/star-wars-cast/) that is beginning soon, starring some famous cast members from the original trilogy: Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher playing their former roles as Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Princess Leia.

To commemorate this day, here is a list of things that Mormons and Star Wars have in common (be warned, there are spoilers ahead for those not familiar with Star Wars):


### The Force




[![Yoda](http://lds.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/the-yoda-reveal-300x178.jpg)](http://lds.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/the-yoda-reveal.jpg)




The [Force ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_(Star_Wars))from Star Wars has many similarities to the Spirit or the[ Holy Ghost](https://www.lds.org/topics/holy-ghost?lang=eng). Like[Yoda ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda)says, “you must feel the Force around you,” likewise, we can feel the Spirit around us when it is invited.


### The Dark Side


[The Dark Side ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_side_(Star_Wars))from Star Wars can be compared to [Satan ](https://www.lds.org/topics/satan?lang=eng)and his ways. The Dark Side encompasses evil, and that is exactly what Satan is.

## Definitive Proof the Jedi Council and Quorum of the 12 are the Same Thing


[![jediapostles](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/jediapostles.jpg)](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/jediapostles.jpg)

What do the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and the most powerful group of Jedi in the galaxy have in common? Well, you might be surprised.


### 1. Both groups work with “the Force.”


Consider the following quote by Obi-Wan: “The Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It’s an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us, it penetrates us, it binds the galaxy together.”

Now consider the following from Chapter 13 of the Gospel Principles manual: “The priesthood is the eternal power and authority of God. Through the priesthood He created and governs the heavens and the earth. By this power the universe is kept in perfect order.”

You can’t read those two quotes and tell us the Priesthood _isn’t_ like the force. And with all the Priesthood keys, you could say the Twelve are Masters of “the Force.”

### 2. Both groups meet in temples regularly.


We are a temple going people, as, remarkably, are the Jedi. Both they and the Twelve use temples in strikingly similar ways.

The Quorum of the 12 meets in the upper room of the Salt Lake City Temple every Thursday to receive direction from the Lord on how His church should be run. Similarly, the Jedi Council met in High Council Chamber in -- get this -- [the top of the northwestern tower of the Jedi Temple to discuss issues regarding the galaxy.](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100413190007/starwars/images/c/ce/SWOldRepublic1CoverB.jpg)

Coincidence? We think not.

### 3. Both groups work closely with local and national governments.


If you could stomach Jar Jar enough to get through the first Star Wars films, you’re probably aware of the interconnected relationship between the Jedi and the Galactic Republic. The Jedi are well-known for being the peacekeepers of the galaxy, fighting for justice, fighting against the dark side, and involving themselves in government to do so (that’s a pretty simplified version of what they do, but you get the picture).

Similarly, members of the Quorum of the Twelve are actively involved in government to defend religious freedom and moral law-making. We frequently see church leaders shaking hands with government leaders in the news as they work with them on various policies. There’s even [an LDS Public Relations office in Washington D.C. ](https://publicaffairs.lds.org/)where members work closely with Priesthood leaders, members of other faiths, and lawmakers to bridge the gap between these three groups. The Twelve are just as concerned about good governing as the Jedi Council.
