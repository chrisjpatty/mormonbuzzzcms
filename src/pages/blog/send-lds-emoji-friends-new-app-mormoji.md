We've been working hard over at Mormon Buzzz to bring you our new app, [Mormon Starter Pack: Mormoji by Mormon Buzzz](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mormon-starter-pack-mormoji/id1155864294?mt=8)! Now you can share the Gospel in style with LDS emoji for iMessage. This is the first in a series of Mormon-themed stickers for iOS 10, and more stickers will be released periodically.
