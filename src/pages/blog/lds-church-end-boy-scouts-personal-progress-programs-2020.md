In a press release published on Mormon Newsroom Tuesday, May 8th, the LDS Church announced plans to end its relationship with all Boy Scouts programs and restructure youth activities by 2020.

"In this century of shared experience, the church has grown from a U.S.-centered institution to a worldwide organization, with a majority of its membership living outside the United States," Church and BSA leadership said in a joint statement released May 8th. "That trend is accelerating. The church has increasingly felt the need to create and implement a uniform youth leadership and development program that serves its members globally. In so doing it will be necessary for the church to discontinue its role as a chartered partner with BSA."

Included in the Church's plan to end its relationship with the Boy Scouts are plans to replace all existing activity and achievement programs, including Personal Progress, Activity Days, Faith in God and Duty to God. A new worldwide initiative for children and youth will be debuted in January of 2020 and replace all previous programs.

The Mormon Newsroom release states, "For years, Church leaders have been preparing a new initiative to teach and provide leadership and development opportunities to all children and youth, to support families and to strengthen youth everywhere as they develop faith in the Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. This new approach is intended to help all girls and boys, young women and young men discover their eternal identity, build character and resilience, develop life skills and fulfill their divine roles as daughters and sons of God. The initiative is designed to allow local leaders, families and even the young people themselves to customize their efforts, while providing service opportunities and activities, fostering healthy relationships and supporting communities."

The Church plans on releasing future details at childrenandyouth.lds.org as the implementation date approaches.
