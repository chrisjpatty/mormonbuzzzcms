We all remember the events of September 11, 2001, but many of us, myself included, were too young at the time to remember much of the aftermath. In pondering these tragic events I realized that I had never read anything about how the Church responded. The Church’s semiannual General Conference was held less than a month after the attacks, at a time when the hurt and confusion was still fresh in the nation’s mind. As I read a talk given by President Gordon B. Hinkley, I was reminded in a wonderful way just how much our Church’s leadership exemplifies the love of Christ. At a time when as a nation many felt angry and vengeful, these were the words of counsel given by our then-current prophet,


<blockquote>“Those of us who are American citizens stand solidly with the president of our nation. The terrible forces of evil must be confronted and held accountable for their actions. This is not a matter of Christian against Muslim. I am pleased that food is being dropped to the hungry people of a targeted nation. We value our Muslim neighbors across the world and hope that those who live by the tenets of their faith will not suffer. I ask particularly that our own people do not become a party in any way to the persecution of the innocent. Rather, let us be friendly and helpful, protective and supportive. It is the terrorist organizations that must be ferreted out and brought down.”</blockquote>


After 9/11 we saw a surge in Islamophobia that is still prevalent today. What a beautiful reminder that these were the actions of a group of extremists, and not the work of an entire faith. He continued, 


<blockquote>“We of this Church know something of such groups. The Book of Mormon speaks of the Gadianton robbers, a vicious, oath-bound, and secret organization bent on evil and destruction. In their day they did all in their power, by whatever means available, to bring down the Church, to woo the people with sophistry, and to take control of the society. We see the same thing in the present situation.”

“We are people of peace. We are followers of the Christ who was and is the Prince of Peace. But there are times when we must stand up for right and decency, for freedom and civilization, just as Moroni rallied his people in his day to the defense of their wives, their children, and the cause of liberty (see [Alma 48:10](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/48.10?lang=eng#9)).”</blockquote>


He reminded us next to be realistic, and to face the future with optimism:


<blockquote>“Now, I do not wish to be an alarmist. I do not wish to be a prophet of doom. I am optimistic. I do not believe the time is here when an all-consuming calamity will overtake us. I earnestly pray that it may not. There is so much of the Lord’s work yet to be done. We, and our children after us, must do it.”</blockquote>


and then turned us towards God, and towards our fellow neighbor:


<blockquote>“Let us be prayerful. Let us pray for righteousness. Let us pray for the forces of good. Let us reach out to help men and women of goodwill, whatever their religious persuasion and wherever they live. Let us stand firm against evil, both at home and abroad. Let us live worthy of the blessings of heaven, reforming our lives where necessary and looking to Him, the Father of us all. He has said, “Be still, and know that I am God” ([Ps. 46:10](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ps/46.10?lang=eng#9)).”

“Are these perilous times? They are. But there is no need to fear. We can have peace in our hearts and peace in our homes. We can be an influence for good in this world, every one of us.”</blockquote>


I was very young when our nation was attacked, and I was unable to fully appreciate the level of fear and doubt that must have prevailed in the hearts of many. What a blessing it was then, as it is now, to have living prophets to remind us what is really important, and how to face the future with faith.
