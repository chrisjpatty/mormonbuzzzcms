### 1. Frame Your Own Printable Home Decor




This is a simple gift idea that will cost you little more than a frame, a sheet of glossy stock paper, and a little creativity. If you've been gifted with graphic design skills, make a classy and unique piece of home decor out of your favorite quote from a general authority. If you're like the rest of us, just download and print one of the many free designs available online. We particularly liked these Articles of Faith posters available at [It's Always Autumn](http://www.itsalwaysautumn.com/2013/11/22/lds-articles-of-faith-free-printables.html).

**Difficulty:** ★☆☆☆☆

### 2. Sew a Homemade Scripture Tote




The perfect personal touch to gift along with a new set of scriptures is a homemade scripture tote. Here's two different styles with instructions. Each one takes a minimal amount of sewing know-how, but they're certainly not unattainable for the DIY beginner.

**Difficulty:** ★★★★☆

### 3. Make a Framed Temple Print


Here's another simple project. Amy Robinson over at [Craftsy.com](http://www.craftsy.com/blog/2015/02/diy-gold-foil-printing/) has put together an simple guide for do-it-yourself gold foil. This project could easily be adapted to make a modern LDS temple print. If you endeavor to do it yourself you can [download a vector file of the Salt Lake Temple here.](http://vector.me/browse/281294/salt_lake_temple_silhouette) Other temples are available online with a little bit of digging. Instructions for a possibly easier alternative using metallic spray paint instead of foil are available over at [todayscreativelife.com](http://todayscreativelife.com/diy-gold-foil-st-patricks-day-prints/).

We also found you can buy these pre-made for fairly cheap over at [Collectivity Lane](https://www.etsy.com/listing/179830184/salt-lake-city-ut-temple-real-gold-or?ref=shop_home_feat_4) if you're not in a DIY mood.

**Difficulty:** ★★☆☆☆

### 4. Sew a Homemade Necktie




At least half the Mormon population needs a new necktie on occasion, so why not gift them a homemade one and save yourself a bit of cash to boot. We found these detailed instructions over at [purlsoho.com](http://www.purlsoho.com/create/2009/05/21/mollys-sketchbook-fathers-day-tie/) if you want to start completely from scratch. An easier alternative is to buy an old thrift store tie that has the width and length you want, and then unfold it to use as a template to cut your fabric. You can even reuse the inner padding if you're happy with the thickness.

If you're feeling particularly trendy, here's some additional instructions to colorblock your new homemade tie.

**Difficulty:** ★★★☆☆

### 5. Make a Personalized Scripture Study or Missionary Journal




This is the perfect personalized gift for your favorite missionary or YSA. We found instructions for these simple and beautiful journals available over at [lilblueboo.com](http://www.lilblueboo.com/2014/12/simple-sharpie-journals-and-matching-gift-wrap.html). Perhaps you could put a favorite scripture on the front, or your missionary's mission motto.

**Difficulty:** ★☆☆☆☆

**Difficulty:** ☆☆☆☆☆
