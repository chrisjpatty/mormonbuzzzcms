What better way to kick off the Easter season than with a quick reminder of the true meaning of the holiday. James Curran wanted to do just that with this video he made with some of our favorite Mormon Celebs! The Sistas in Zion: Tamu Smith and Zandra Vranes, and Jenn Blosil: former contestant of the 15th season of American Idol, teamed up with James to spread some Easter cheer.

Curran shared with us an amazing missionary moment he and Jenn had while filming the video;
"The best part about this experience was when Jenn and I were able to do some missionary work. There was a young but very tall African american looking gentleman who walked past us a few times as we were filming. So Jenn and I walked over to him and asked him if he was LDS and if he would like to be in our video. He said that he "was" LDS but had since fallen away since moving here from New York. Jenn just happened to be a missionary in New York and guess what? She served in his home branch. I felt prompted to ask him if he did music and guess what? He raps! I quickly informed him that I was not a rapper, but that I love to rap as a hobby. We all exchanged numbers and have plans to hang out this week. He actually invited Jenn and I to come down to Salt Lake to freestyle with him."

What a beautiful example of the right people being in the right place at the right time. But what really made the difference was them reaching out and opening their mouths. The perfect way to celebrate Easter is to make sure our brothers and sisters are partaking of the joys of the Atonement. Let's reach out a little further, Thanks James and Jenn for the awesome example!
