Jonny was born with many complications including a twisted foot that needed extensive surgery. Due to his condition he has no living muscles in his leg and he is paralyzed in most of his body. However, Jonny has defied all odds as his dreams to run and play like other boys pushes him to conquer his crippling handicap. His story has and will continue to bless countless lives. Jonny’s older sister had this to say;


<blockquote>"I think one of the greater miracles that has happened to my family would have to be about my brother, Jonny. I can't count how many prayers we've offered on his behalf from before he was even born. We were told he would be born severely handicapped from a cyst in his brain. Miraculously he wasn't. We were told he would never walk, run, ride a bike and he's proven doctors wrong on all accounts. But the sweetest miracle we've seen is how it's brought us closer as a family. The greatest miracle came from when we were realized God wasn't going to heal Jonny completely, even when we had faith the He could. I knew Heavenly Father could heal my brother and protect him from years of pain and ridicule from peers. But He answered no. It was the most faith trying experience I had, I wondered why my faith wasn't enough. Over the years I've learned that God knows better what miracles we need and when we need them. I wouldn't trade the miracle of completely trusting Gods plan for my brother for anything. We've worked hard with him and struggled with him and I've seen the miracle of his adversity turn my little brother to the amazing man he is becoming. Jonny has been an amazing missionary to many, including my family. We've recognized the miraculous moments of healing. Even though his struggles have never gone away, we've learned I rejoice in the victories as they come and be grateful for trails that can make us strong."</blockquote>


[Jonny was honored in 2011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPOPad4yHpU&feature=youtu.be) by the BYU Football Thursdays Heroes program and was able to spend a practice with his favorite football team. Jonny still continues to defy all odds and is always striving to push his limits. His life is a miracle and this miracle brings joy to his friends and family every day.

March 2015, 18-month-year-old Lily was rescued after being suspended in her car seat in an overturned car for almost 14 hours in the freezing river near Spanish Fork, Utah. A fisherman noticed the car almost half a day after the accident, because it wasn’t visible from the roadway. Rescuers immediately responded to his report and stepped into the icy river to flip over the car, where it became clear that the driver, Lily’s 25-year-old mother, was deceased. Rescuers noticed that the baby was unconscious, but still alive. It was nothing short of miraculous that the child, left alone without food or water in freezing temperatures for 14 hours, could have survived such an ordeal. Probably the most striking miracle to occur was when responders claimed they distinctly heard a voice calling for help coming from the vehicle, and it was not the voice of a child.


### 3. When a bomb was detonated in a classroom full of children and all the children survived.

May 16, 1986, David Young and his wife Doris entered an elementary school in Cokeville Wyoming and took 136 children and 18 adults hostage with firearms and a homemade bomb. They gathered everyone in the school into one classroom. He attached the bomb to his wrist and threatened the group that he might, at any time, move his arm and ignite the bomb. He demanded 2 million dollars per child and an audience with the President Regan. After a two and a half hour standoff, the children became restless and offered a prayer. Soon after the prayer the bomb was accidentally detonated and teachers began helping the students through open windows and out the doors through the smoke and fire to safety. Every child and adult in the room escaped with their lives except for the two perpetrators David and Doris Young. There lots of little miracles associated with this event and they are all beautifully portrayed in T.C. Christensen's newest film [Cokeville Miracle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn20a71m45M), in theaters today June 5. The movie focuses on the miracle surrounding the event rather than the sensationalism of a crazy man taking children hostage. It emphasizes the power of prayer, a miracle, and God’s grace. If this movie doesn’t make you believe in miracles again, I don’t know what will.

### 4. When two thirteen year old girls were saved after their boat capsized on Bear Lake.

On June 1st, 2015, a sudden storm with extreme wind gusts settled over Bear Lake, in the Northeastern corner of Utah. Strong winds caused a boat carrying seven individuals to capsize, and those individuals fought the waves while they waited for rescue. Two teens in the group, Tiffany Stoker, 13, and Tylinn Tilly, 13, reported that when the boat capsized, they felt as if they were lifted up and gently placed into the water a safe distance from the boat. The Tiffany and Tylinn then decided to embark on their own and began swimming toward shore for help. As they swam they encouraged each other and would massage each others legs when they got cramps. They sang primary hymns and prayed together even though they had to shout over the roar of the waves. When the sun went down they began to lose hope, but a final glimmer of light from the sky gave them just the motivation they needed to swim a little bit farther. A search and rescue boat found them soon after, both cold and weak, they were rescued three hours after the boat capsized. Kathryn Capener also survived the ordeal, however, her husband Lance, her daughters Kelsey, 13,  Kilee, 7 and a family friend Siera Hadley, 13, didn’t survive. While this miracle is surrounded by tragedy we cannot deny the heavenly hand that surrounded the rescue of these two teenagers.


### 5. When a young mother and her husband survived a plane crash and lived to raise their children.

Stephanie Nielson and her husband Christian miraculously survived a plane crash in 2008. While the crash left them with severe burns, they were able to return home to their four children. Stephanie was in a coma for four months, and while she experienced excruciating pain, the greatest pain was battling the fact that her burns left her scarred and disfigured. While she struggled with the fact that she’d never be beautiful again, she was reassured to know that she was still alive to be a mother to her children, she could still eat her favorite foods, and that she could still kiss her husband. Since the accident, Stephanie has inspired millions with her blog and was [ featured in a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHDvxPjsm8E) on the Mormon Channel. She also wrote a memoir that she hopes will bring comfort to others facing adversity. Her miracle continues to edify millions.
