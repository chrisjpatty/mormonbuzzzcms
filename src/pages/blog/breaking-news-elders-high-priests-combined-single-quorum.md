During the Priesthood session of the 188th annual general conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, newly sustained President Russell M. Nelson announced a surprise restructuring of ward and branch priesthood quorums; Elders and High Priest quorums are to be combined into a single quorum, and will be referred to as the "Elders Quorum".

To accomplish this historic change, effective as soon as conveniently possible all current High Priest and Elders quorum presidencies will be released, and a new combined presidency will be called. This presidency may consist of both elders and/or high priests.
