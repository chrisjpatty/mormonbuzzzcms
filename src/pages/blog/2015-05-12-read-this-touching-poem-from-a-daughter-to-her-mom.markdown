My Mom and I haven’t always been close. In fact, when I heard other girls say that their mom was their best friend, I never thought I’d be able to say the same thing. I wish I could take back the times that I distanced myself from her. But the older I grew, the more I realized that my mom was the one real friend that would always be there, always return my calls, and always love me… no matter what. I realized that my mom is a person too, with good days and bad days, strengths and weaknesses, triumphs and sorrows. We are both far from perfect, but without her love, acceptance, and guidance, I truly would not be where I am today. We truly have become best friends. I love you, Mom.

_This poem is for all the mother hearts that surround us, whether they be our biological mothers, a friend, aunt, grandmother, or the neighbor down the street. Thank you for opening your hearts, and for inspiring us to someday become mothers like you._




#### Dear Mom,




Who would have taught me not to be scared of the dark,

Or of the monsters downstairs, or of the big slide in the park?

Who would have shown me how to walk, and tie shoes

And that there are good or bad consequences for each action I choose?

Who would have listened to my long melodramas

And stayed up too late helping with my school dioramas?

Who would have noticed when I felt sad and alone

Who would have sung lullabies and soothed me in all the right tones?

Who would have shown me to be patient and kind?

Who would have believed in me when I was so far behind?

Who could have seen all the potential within me?

And told me “keep going, I know how good you will be.”

Who would have forgiven me after the rude things I said

And give me a hug and a kiss when I was tucked into bed?

Who could have known all the right things to do

For all of my problems and things I went through

Who would have found my missing left shoe

Who would have supported all the dreams I’ve pursued?

Who else would wake early just to pack me my lunch

And who would have made your famous lemonade punch?

Who would have taught me about Jesus Christ?

Who would have shown me how to walk in the light?

Who would have told stories of courage and faith?

Who would have testified of truth and of grace?

Who would have held me and told me it was alright

After falling short yet again in this great mortal fight?

And who in the world could be better than you

To convince me unconditional love can extend to me too?

Only my angel mother could have done this and more

You’ve given me wings and taught me to soar.

I’m truly in debt, with every breath

I love you forever, love won’t stop after death.

Let it be etched into the book of my life

That I love you, dear mother.

Sincerely,


#### Your daughter
