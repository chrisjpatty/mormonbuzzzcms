We all know the Disney princesses for their lovable natures, magical adventures, and proclivity for needing rescue, but what if our favorite Disney princesses had answered the prophet's call to serve as missionaries?


# Belle





	
  * Strengths: Memorized the entire Standard Works.

	
  * Most Converts: The sheep


Sister Belle was quite the scriptorian, and though she avoided them as much as possible, she was quite the formidable opponent in a Bible bash.

[![Sister Belle loves The Book of Mormon: "This is my favorite book" - Mormonbuzzz.com](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Belle-With-Book-Of-Mormon-1024x576.jpg)](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Belle-With-Book-Of-Mormon.jpg)Belle's strengths lay in her knowledge, but she was also extremely social.  She would often gather groups on the street like the original missionaries did.

#  Jasmine





	
  * Strengths: Church tours and avoiding marriage

	
  * Weaknesses: Kleptomania


Sister Jasmine was great with kids.  She strived to follow the instructions in _Preach My Gospel _to seek out and teach families.

The local "street rats" took it upon themselves to protect the sisters, and were often helping them escape disgruntled shopkeeps.

# Ariel





	
  * Strengths: Unmatched charisma, ASL trained

	
  * Weaknesses: Mute


Ariel had always wanted to serve a mission, so when Thomas S. Monson announced that she could leave two years earlier than she had planned, she was ready to go.

[![Ariel-Going-On-A-Mission](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Ariel-Going-On-A-Mission1-1024x576.jpg)](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Ariel-Going-On-A-Mission1.jpg)Sister Ariel was originally called to the land-dwellers non-speaking mission, but her visa took a while to be approved so she spent some time in the Under-Sea Guppy Speaking Mission

[![Ariel-Teaching-The-Fish](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Ariel-Teaching-The-Fish.jpg)](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Ariel-Teaching-The-Fish.jpg)The culture took some getting used to, so dinners with members were pretty interesting.

[![This fish is delicious Bro. & Sis. Eric mormonbuzzz.com](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Ariel-Accessories.jpg)](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Ariel-Accessories.jpg)Upon her return it didn't take Ariel long to rekindle her relationship with her high school boyfriend.  They were engaged in two weeks.

[![ariel_Married](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ariel_Married.gif)](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ariel_Married.gif)Yes, Ariel was _that_ sister.


# Mulan





	
  * Weapon of choice: Pass-along cards

	
  * Most embarrassing moment: Dressed up as an Elder but got caught


Sister Mulan had the testimony of a lion.  Her approach was aggressive, but proved to be effective.

[![Mulan-Wait-Read-This](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Mulan-Wait-Read-This1-1024x817.jpg)](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Mulan-Wait-Read-This1.jpg)She became quite fond of the pass-along cards, so when she had the chance to meet the emperor of China, she didn't hesitate.

[![Mulan-Pass-Along-Cards](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Mulan-Pass-Along-Cards.jpg)](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Mulan-Pass-Along-Cards.jpg)Her persistence paid off, but unfortunately, not everyone appreciated it.

# Aurora





	
  * Strengths: Voice of a song-bird

	
  * Most Embarrassing Moment: Fell into a deep sleep while helping an investigator with a sewing project.


Sister Aurora was particularly adept at working with the woodland creatures.  Many avian families were united in the Gospel during her ministry.

[![Aurora-Together-Forever](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Aurora-Together-Forever-1024x571.jpg)](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Aurora-Together-Forever.jpg)She wasn't afraid to talk to anyone, and her questions were as golden as her hair.

[![aurora-Mormons](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/aurora-Mormons.jpg)](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/aurora-Mormons.jpg)Unfortunately Sister Aurora developed a bad case of narcolepsy, and after 13 months returned to her castle to recover.  After the spell was broken she was blessed to be able to return and complete her 18 months.


# Cinderella





	
  * Strengths: Hard-working & Service-minded

	
  * Weaknesses: Often distracted by dreams of marrying a handsome prince


Sister Cinderella had a kind heart, and was often found helping people with household chores.

[![cinderella-service](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/cinderella-service.jpg)](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/cinderella-service.jpg)

She would go to great lengths to help her investigators keep their commitments.  She even once switched out a family's entire stash of coffee with hot chocolate.

[![Cinderella-Hot-Chocolate](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Cinderella-Hot-Chocolate.jpg)](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Cinderella-Hot-Chocolate.jpg)

For Sister Cinderella the evening schedule was never an issue.  She was more than grateful for an excuse to be in well before midnight.  When her companions would question her about her peculiar aversion to pumpkins and mice, she would just sigh heavily and stare off into space.  Sister Cinderella was always obedient, but before all else she made sure to follow the instruction to have attractive shoes.


# Pocahontas





	
  * Strengths: Testimony as strong as the tallest oak trees.

	
  * Weaknesses: None. She was flawless.


Pocahontas was actually a convert to the Church.  After reading and praying about the Book of Mormon, she knew what she had to do.

[![Pocahontos-Reading-The-Book-Of-Mormon](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Pocahontos-Reading-The-Book-Of-Mormon.jpg)](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Pocahontos-Reading-The-Book-Of-Mormon.jpg)Sister Pocahontas had faith like you wouldn't believe, almost too much sometimes.

[![Pocahauntus-Leaping](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Pocahauntus-Leaping.jpg)](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Pocahauntus-Leaping.jpg)Sister Pocahontas was patient as the rushing waters, and her lessons as varied and interesting as the colors of the wind.  She took seriously the council in _Preach My Gospel_ to, "Not be afraid of silence," and occasionally had to quiet her companions to let the Holy Ghost do His work.[![Pocahauntus-Spirit](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Pocahauntus-Spirit.jpg)](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Pocahauntus-Spirit.jpg)


# Snow White





	
  * Strengths: Extremely neat & tidy, and always baked pies for district meeting

	
  * Weaknesses: Morning schedule.


Sister White was very tidy, and always made sure to keep her apartment clean.  She and her companion were once transferred into an area to replace the Elders, and were astonished to find that whole place had been infested with vermin.

[![Snow-White-Cleaning](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Snow-White-Cleaning-1024x760.jpg)](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Snow-White-Cleaning.jpg)Sister White was a diligent missionary, but the morning schedule wasn't her strong point.

[![Snow-White-Tired](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Snow-White-Tired.jpg)](http://mormonbuzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Snow-White-Tired.jpg)Despite her weaknesses, Sister White was an extraordinary missionary.  The food-related near death experiences of her past life came in handy when teaching The Word of Wisdom, and she helped many an investigator escape addictions.

### And they all lived happily ever after.
