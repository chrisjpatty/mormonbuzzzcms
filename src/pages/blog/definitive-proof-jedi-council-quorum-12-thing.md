What do the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and the most powerful group of Jedi in the galaxy have in common? Well, you might be surprised.


### 1. Both groups work with “the Force.”




Consider the following quote by Obi-Wan: “The Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It’s an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us, it penetrates us, it binds the galaxy together.”

Now consider the following from Chapter 13 of the Gospel Principles manual: “The priesthood is the eternal power and authority of God. Through the priesthood He created and governs the heavens and the earth. By this power the universe is kept in perfect order.”

You can’t read those two quotes and tell us the Priesthood _isn’t_ like the force. And with all the Priesthood keys, you could say the Twelve are Masters of “the Force.”

### 2. Both groups meet in temples regularly.




We are a temple going people, as, remarkably, are the Jedi. Both they and the Twelve use temples in strikingly similar ways.

The Quorum of the 12 meets in the upper room of the Salt Lake City Temple every Thursday to receive direction from the Lord on how His church should be run. Similarly, the Jedi Council met in High Council Chamber in -- get this -- [the top of the northwestern tower of the Jedi Temple to discuss issues regarding the galaxy.](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100413190007/starwars/images/c/ce/SWOldRepublic1CoverB.jpg)

Coincidence? We think not.

### 3. Both groups work closely with local and national governments.




If you could stomach Jar Jar enough to get through the first Star Wars films, you’re probably aware of the interconnected relationship between the Jedi and the Galactic Republic. The Jedi are well-known for being the peacekeepers of the galaxy, fighting for justice, fighting against the dark side, and involving themselves in government to do so (that’s a pretty simplified version of what they do, but you get the picture).

Similarly, members of the Quorum of the Twelve are actively involved in government to defend religious freedom and moral law-making. We frequently see church leaders shaking hands with government leaders in the news as they work with them on various policies. There’s even [an LDS Public Relations office in Washington D.C. ](https://publicaffairs.lds.org/)where members work closely with Priesthood leaders, members of other faiths, and lawmakers to bridge the gap between these three groups. The Twelve are just as concerned about good governing as the Jedi Council.

### 4. Both groups are well-versed in modern technology.




We probably won’t see a member of the Twelve in a holographic, droid-projected message anytime soon, but we do see them posting Facebook statuses and using hashtags today, and that’s a pretty big deal. The apostles like to stay just as connected as the Jedi do, and who knows? Maybe we’ll have holographic general conference in the near future.

### 5. Both groups are very interested in the youth.




One thing the Jedi are always concerned about is the spiritual well-being and training of the younglings chosen to become Jedi Knights. Case in point: Anakin. The Twelve Apostles likewise are concerned about strengthening the spiritual well-being of youth in the church. You could almost say that EFY, Duty to God, Seminary, and Personal Progress are latter-day Padawan training programs.

### 6. For both groups, age is just a number.




Do you remember that one time in Attack of the Clones when 900-year-old, cane-using Yoda went all little, green fighting machine on Count Dooku? We’re not saying that the apostles are capable of stunts like that, but one look at 93-year-old Elder Perry’s spry walk makes us wonder if they’ve found the same fountain of youth the Jedi have.

### 7. Both have twelve members.




There are twelve apostles and there are twelve members of the Jedi High Council. Need we say more?

### 8. Both groups are super boss.




Yes. Yes, we can say more.
