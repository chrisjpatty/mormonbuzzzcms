The first presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, along with the general primary presidency, announced today that the age for children to be admitted into sunbeams will be changed from age three to age two. This announcement comes at the heels of the 2012 decision to lower the mission age. The general primary presidency stated that they have been very impressed by the spiritual maturity of many two-year-olds in the church and feel like the time has come that they begin their primary education even earlier.

They said, “We think this will be a wonderful opportunity to help hasten the work. Those little angels are prepared for this change, and we know that the teachers will step up as well. We aren’t suggesting that all of these children should enter primary at this earlier age, but that the option is available. The children should still make it a matter of prayer.”

This new policy has already been quietly tested in stakes around the world.  One primary teacher in a test stake in Springfield, Illinois stated, “We found that the two-year-olds were just as noisy and obnoxious as the rest of the primary children.  I think it makes a lot of sense for the church to do this.”

Parents are thrilled about the announcement, but not as excited as their children. Emma, a recently turned two-year-old from Taylorsville, Utah had this to say when she heard the announcement: “I go to Primary now!” She, along with her parents, have already contacted their local primary president to arrange her transition from nursery to Sunbeams.

As part of this change, the church has released a set of pamphlets outlining the rules and responsibilities primary children are expected to follow.  Parents are encouraged to have their children start studying these pamphlets as early as six months old to help ensure a smooth transition into primary.

It’s rumored that the primary curriculum has also been changed. Starting in CTR 7, children will now be required to memoriz_e_ “The Family: A Proclamation” and “The Living Christ” alongside the “Articles of Faith” before graduating primary. Elder Andersen told reporters, “It’s time for the younger and _even younger _generation to participate in the work of salvation. This new curriculum will surely help them do just that.”

There has been speculation as to whether or not the church is going to make a decision on lowering the age for stake dance admittance from 14 to 13. When asked about it, Elder Holland simply laughed and said, “One miracle at a time.”

Happy April First!
