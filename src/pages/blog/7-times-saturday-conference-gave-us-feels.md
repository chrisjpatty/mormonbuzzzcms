We don’t know about you, but we’re a little [read: a lotta] emotional after this weekend’s general conference. Here are ten times conference made us feel all of the feels:  



**1. When members of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir wept through “Come Thou Fount,” especially this man:**

*Cue sudden and unexpected sobbing.



**2. When new apostle Elder Rasband’s voice wavered as he expressed his deepest gratitude for those praying for and sustaining him.**

**3. When the camera panned to Sister Wixom’s tear-filled eyes as the Primary Presidency got released.**

We're okay...we're...not okay. *cry*



**4. When President Monson and Elder Hales had to be helped by security/other apostles to the pulpit and we were all emotionally them. **

**5. When Elder Kearon shared his experiences with refugees and you could see the love pouring from his tender British eyes.**

*sniff* We’re not crying! *sniff* 



**6. When President Uchtdorf, visibly touched by Elder Kearon’s remarks, was barely able to conduct the rest of the meeting through his tears.**

CAN'T. EMOTIONALLY. HANDLE.



**7. When President Eyring choked up during his opening comments as he pleaded with us to listen to the prophet; again, when Elder Arnold talked about rescuing those who have gone astray. Pretty much during every single talk. #RealTalk**

**8. When Elder Johnson spoke about the death of his daughter and read an excerpt from her journal about the hope the resurrection brings.**

We're done. Just...so done. *hiccuping sob*



**9. When Elder Holland spoke to our souls and asked us if we knew how much Church leaders love us.**

**10. When conference ended far too quickly.  **
