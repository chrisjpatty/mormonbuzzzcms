The makers of the smash hits, _FaithChat™_ and _Angry Mormons™_ announced this week the release of _Gospel Go™_. In similar fashion to the Pokemon-themed game, _Gospel Go_ overlays your physical world with virtual indicators guiding members to locations where they can seek out and catch converts. One of the app’s early beta testers, Matthew Higgins, had this to say, “I used to have to follow the Holy Ghost when looking out for people to share the Gospel with, but with _Gospel Go_ the experience is much more streamlined. I’ve baptized enough converts to start a new branch in the last week alone.”

[![Gospel-Go-Screenshot-1](/img/Gospel-Go-Screenshot-1.jpg)](/img/Gospel-Go-Screenshot-1.jpg)The app works by drawing on membership records and newly digitized missionary area books to identify areas of usual missionary success. There’s even a section for home and visiting teaching which rewards your virtual missionary with upgrades and extra materials if you spend at least 30 minutes per month in your teachees’ homes. Users who catch converts are directed to the nearest LDS meetinghouse (marked by distinct indicators pulled from LDS Tools) to help their converts progress in their spiritual evolution. Early testers are calling it, “The Liahona for the modern age.”

[![Gospel-Go-Screenshot-2](/img/Gospel-Go-Screenshot-2.jpg)](/img/Gospel-Go-Screenshot-2.jpg)The app has been in beta since May, but was released to the public Monday and has since skyrocketed in popularity among church members of all ages. Due to the increasing mania surrounding _Gospel Go_ and reports of app-related trespassing, area presidencies are reminding members to use discretion. Edward Schaefermeyer, a bishop, said, “Just because you find a potential investigator on this app does not mean you can waltz through their yard and into their home. Members need to remember that the missionaries are knocking, and so should they.”

Schaefermeyer also stressed that traditional member missionary work “works just fine” if members are reluctant to join the _Gospel Go_ craze.

Members can head over to their phone’s [app store](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) to get started baptizing today.
