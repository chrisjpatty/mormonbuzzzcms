Today President Henry B. Eyring of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints announced two new apostles during Solemn Assembly, Elder Gerrit W. Gong and Elder Ulisses Soares, who, effective immediately, will take the places vacated by Elder Robert D. Hales and Dallin H. Oaks in the quorum.

These appointments underscore the LDS Church's growing international identity and membership. Elder Gong, born in Redwood City, California, is the first Asian-American member of the quorum of the twelve apostles, while Elder Soares, born in São Paulo, Brazil, is both the first Brazilian apostle, and the first apostle from South America.

It's the first time in three years that new members have been added to the Quorum of the Twelve . Elders Dale G. Renlund, Ronald A. Rasband, and Gary E. Stevenson were called in October of 2015.

The Church's announcement comes at a time of great change for the Church. With the passing of President Thomas S. Monson in January, the Church has undergone a change in leadership under the direction of new Prophet Russell M. Nelson and continues to enact change in policy and Church curriculum.

As members of the Twelve, Soares and Gong will travel around the world to visit with saints, make decisions regarding Church policy, speak in conferences and firesides, and lead future Church initiatives.
