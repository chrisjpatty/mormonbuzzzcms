What might have been like if millennials had lived during the time of the pioneers? Would they have sang as they walked and walked and posted, tweeted, liked, tagged, shared, and commented on the pioneer trek west? What kind of things would we share? In the spirit of Pioneer Day, enjoy as two time periods collide in #PrairieProbs.

Thank heaven for the brave men and women who, without even a Tumblr account, crossed the plains to settle the west. We honor and revere them, but it's probably a good thing our generation wasn't asked to brave the wild frontier. I'm sure the pioneers would be glad they don't have to brave the wild Vine feeds.

Happy Pioneer Day!
